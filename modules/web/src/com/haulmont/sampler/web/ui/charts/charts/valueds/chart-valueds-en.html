<p>Value datasources enable execution of queries that return scalar values and aggregates. Value datasources work with
    entities of a special type named <code>KeyValueEntity</code>. This entity can contain an arbitrary number of
    attributes which are defined at runtime. Value datasources are designed only for reading data, because
    <code>KeyValueEntity</code> is not persistent and cannot be saved by standard persistence mechanisms.</p>
