<p>In this example, two component methods are implemented that will be invoked:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>If the number of entered characters is less than the value of <code>minSearchStringLength</code> attribute.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If the search of characters entered by the user has returned no results.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Besides, the list of actions is specified explicitly and includes <code>clear</code> action.</p>
