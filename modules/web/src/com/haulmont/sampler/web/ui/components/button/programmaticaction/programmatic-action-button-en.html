<p>Button actions can be created programmatically in the screen controller by deriving them from
    <a href="https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-6.9/baseAction.html">BaseAction</a> class.</p>

<p>In this example, the button caption is created dynamically by overriding <code>getCaption()</code> method of the
    assigned action.</p>
