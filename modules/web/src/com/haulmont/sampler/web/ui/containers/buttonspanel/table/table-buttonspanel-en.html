<p><code>ButtonsPanel</code> is a container that streamlines the use and placement of the components (usually, buttons)
    for data management in a table.</p>

<p><code>buttonsPanel</code> element can be located either inside a <code>table</code>, or in any other place of a
    screen.</p>

<p>If the <code>buttonsPanel</code> is located in a <code>table</code>, it is combined with the table&#39;s <a
        href="https://doc.cuba-platform.com/manual-6.9/gui_Table.html#gui_Table_rowsCount"
        target="_blank">rowsCount</a> component thus using vertical space more effectively. Additionally, if a lookup
    screen is opened using <code>Frame.openLookup()</code> (for example, from the <a
            href="open?screen=simple-pickerfield">PickerField</a> component) the buttons panel becomes hidden.</p>
